- Removed `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for authentication
- Removed `authenticated` and `jwt_token` checks
- Default route now always redirects to admin dashboard
- No conditional rendering based on auth status

---

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Start the application:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Access any dashboard directly:**

   - Just paste any URL from above into your browser
   - No login required
   - All pages are immediately accessible

3. **Navigate via sidebar:**
   - Sidebar still works normally
   - Click any menu item to navigate
   - Each role's sidebar shows their specific menu items

---

## üìù Notes

### **Sidebar Behavior:**

- The sidebar will still show role-specific menus based on the CRM context
- If no user is logged in, you may see a default menu
- To see a specific role's sidebar, you can still use the login page to set the user context

### **CRM Context:**

- The CRM Provider still manages user state
- Login functionality still works if you want to set a user context
- But it's no longer required to access any page

### **Testing Different Roles:**

You can still login to set the user context and see role-specific sidebars:

```
Admin: admin@admin.com / 123456
Manager: manager@manager.com / 123456
Sales: sales@sales.com / 123456
Support: support@support.com / 123456
Marketing: marketing@marketing.com / 123456
```
