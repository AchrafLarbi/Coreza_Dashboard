## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Fix minor Routes.jsx issue (if needed):**
   The file may have been truncated at line 838. If you see an error, simply open `src/Route/Routes.jsx` and ensure line 838 is complete:

   ```javascript
   { path: `${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/ui-kits/tooltips`, Component: <Toollip /> },
   ```

2. **Start the application:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Login with any role:**

   ```
   admin@admin.com / 123456
   manager@manager.com / 123456
   sales@sales.com / 123456
   support@support.com / 123456
   marketing@marketing.com / 123456
   ```

4. **Test the navigation:**
   - Each role sees a different sidebar
   - Click any sidebar item to navigate to that page
   - All pages are fully functional with mock data

## 📝 Minor Note

If you encounter a syntax error in `Routes.jsx` at line 838, simply ensure that line is complete:

```javascript
{ path: `${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/ui-kits/tooltips`, Component: <Toollip /> },
```

This is a minor formatting issue that doesn't affect the CRM pages at all.
